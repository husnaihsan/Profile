# Introduction
Hi! I'm Husna, a student in the Framework-Based Software Design and Development course. 
I’m looking forward to learning more about how modern software maintenance works in real-world projects, especially how to handle and improve older or legacy systems. It’ll be interesting to see how teams keep things running smoothly while still updating and adapting the software to new needs.
